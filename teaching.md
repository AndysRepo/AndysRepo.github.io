I taught a module named **Machine Learning Methods in Computational Biophysics** in the course of **Molecular Modeling of Biological Systems** (6 CFU)
taught at Cagliari University (Italy) by **Prof. Attilio V. Vargiu**
In particular, the course ([here](https://unica.it/unica/en/ateneo_s07_ss01_sss02.page?mu=Guide/PaginaADErogata.do?ad_er_id=2022*N0*N0*S1*40674*20723&ANNO_ACCADEMICO=2022&mostra_percorsi=S) the link to the syllabus) is thought to give a broad overview of  different techniques routinely used in computational biophysics, such as protein sequence alignment, molecular dynamics simulations and molecular docking.
In this context, the machine learning module was thought to give the students an insight into the capabilities of machine learning algorithms when applied to study the biophysical world.

The syllabus of the *Machine Learning module* taught is reported below. 

• Introduction to big data, artificial intelligence, machine and deep learning;
• Unsupervised vs supervised learning: similarities and differences;
• The concept of "feature";
• Unsupervised learning: clustering algorithms (hierarchical and partitioning methods);
• The K-means algorithm: theory and examples. Defining the optimal number of clusters with the "Elbow" and "Silhouette" methods. Inizialization techniques (random, Forgy, Kmeans++);
• Introduction to the "Natural language processing" (NLP);
• The Bag-of-Words (BoW) model. K-mers and N-grams;
• Supervised learning: classification vs. regression tasks;
• Building the model: training, validation and test sets;
• The concept of "cost function". K-fold cross validation and overfitting;
• Performance evaluation: the confusion matrix. Sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy metrics;
• K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support-Vector Machines (SVM) models (theory and examples);
• Introduction to python libraries for ML applications (with worked examples);
• *Practical tutorial* (unsupervised learning): clustering protein conformations with the K-means algorithm;
• *Practical tutorial* (supervised learning): predicting protein families from DNA sequences of different organisms.
