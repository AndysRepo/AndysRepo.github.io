<p>
Physicist by education, data scientist by heart and computer geek by vocation, I have always been attracted by interdisciplinary challenges. For this reason, after obtaining a M.Sci. in Physics, I completed a Ph.D. in Applied Physics working in Computational Biophysics and then a Post-Graduate specialization in Machine Learning.

<p>This page is intended to <font color="color:blue;"><a href="https://andysrepo.github.io/projects/">share some projects I have worked on</a></font>, mostly concerning biophysics, applications of machine learning to real life problems, data analysis exercises and some fun with the SQL language (which I have recently started learning)</U>.
