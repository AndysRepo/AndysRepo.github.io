<p>I am a Post-Doctoral Researcher at the University of Cagliari (Italy), working at the Physics Department, in the <a href="https://molmod.dsf.unica.it/people">“Molecular Modelling” group</a>. Graduated in Physics, since my bachelor’s degree, I realized computational physics and data analysis were among the subjects I liked the most. For this reason, when looking for my bachelor’s degree thesis, I tried to combine those subjects with some other personal interests. In doubt between Computational Geophysics or Biophysics, I ended up choosing the latter, and working on the role of the aqueous solvent in the extrusion of substrates (e.g. antibiotics) by bacterial efflux transporter proteins.
</p>

<p>Then, since I was enjoying that subject a lot, Computational Biophysics was chosen again for my master’s degree thesis, this time working on a computational protocol to improve the predictive power of molecular docking, a technique used to reproduce the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand complexes starting from the unbound partners. I went on working on the same project also during my Ph.D., which I ended in early 2020. This field was actually what I was looking for. It allowed me to feel surrounded by biochemistry (a personal interest of mine) while having fun with computer simulations and programming.
</p>

<p>Moreover, by the end of the same year, I started becoming fascinated by “Machine Learning" and its manifold applications. For this reason, I enrolled in a postgraduate specialization in "Machine Learning and Big Data for Biomedical applications", offered by the University of Padua, from which I graduated in September 2022.
At the moment, my job as Post-Doctoral Researcher is focused on the development of novel software and protocols, also including machine learning techniques, to address problems mostly related to molecular recognition events between proteins and ligands.
</p>
<p>Other than that, my passions include programming, ancient philosophy, fitness and outdoor activities.

<p>This page is mostly thought to <U><font color="color:red;">share some projects I am working on in my spare time</font></U>, mostly concerning applications of machine learning to real life problems, data analysis exercises and some fun with the SQL language (which I have recently started learning)</U>.
