<p>Here are some of the projects I've been working on:</p>

<p>[<u>Biophysics</u>] EDES tutorial.<br>
<a href="https://molmod.dsf.unica.it/edes/">Here</a> you will find a tutorial for the protocol the "Enhanced Sampling of Binding and Pocket Volume and Shape" (EDES) developed during my Ph.D. <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00730">(link to the publication)</a>. In the tutorial, we will exploit enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics, namely metadynamics, to improve the sampling of bound-like (holo) conformations of a generic protein starting from its unbound (apo) one. <br>

[<u>Machine Learning</u>] Sentiment Analysis.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/AndysRepo/andysrepo.github.io/blob/main/ML_projects/sentiment_analysis/Sentiment_analysis.ipynb">Here</a> a simple implementation of the sentimental analysis. Given a sentence, the model predicts if it conveys a positive, negative or neutral feeling. The code is based on the "Natural Language ToolKit" (NLTK) python library. A logistic regression model has been used, minimizing the cost function with the gradient descent method. Both logistic model and the gradient descent method have been implemented from scratch. <br>
