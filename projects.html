<p>Here are some of the projects I've been working on, organized in categories:</p>
<p>
Legend (for categories):<br>
<span style="color: red">Bio</span> = Biophysics<br>
<span style="color: red">ML</span> = Machine Learning<br>
<span style="color: red">DB</span> = Database (tipically involving SQL)<br>
</p>

<p>[<span style="color: red">Bio</span>] <b>EDES</b> tutorial.<br>
<a href="https://molmod.dsf.unica.it/edes/">Here</a> you will find a tutorial for the protocol the "Enhanced Sampling of Binding and Pocket Volume and Shape" (EDES) developed during my Ph.D. <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00730">(link to the publication)</a>. In the tutorial, we will exploit enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics, namely metadynamics, to improve the sampling of bound-like (holo) conformations of a generic protein starting from its unbound (apo) one. <br>
</p>
<p>
[<span style="color: red">ML/Bio</span>] <b>K-means clustering</b> of protein conformations.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/AndysRepo/andysrepo.github.io/blob/main/ML_projects/clustering">Here</a> a tutorial about the usage of K-means clusteringon protein conformations used for <a href="https://andysrepo.github.io/teaching/">teaching</a>. However, the whole code can be used with any dataset and it is not protein-specific. The code is based on the Scikit-learn library, and it also implements: (i) feature normalization; (ii) identifying cluster representatives from centroids; (iii) the elbow and silhouette methods for the choice of the optimal number of clusters. The folder also contains a tcl script to extract some of the features employed in the tutorial from a molecular dynamics trajectory using the VMD software.

<p>
[<span style="color: red">ML</span>] <b>Sentiment Analysis</b>.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/AndysRepo/andysrepo.github.io/blob/main/ML_projects/sentiment_analysis/Sentiment_analysis.ipynb">Here</a> a simple implementation of the sentiment analysis. Given a sentence, the model predicts if it conveys a positive, negative or neutral feeling. The code is based on the "Natural Language ToolKit" (NLTK) python library. A logistic regression model has been used, minimizing the cost function with the gradient descent method. Both logistic model and the gradient descent method have been implemented from scratch. <br>
