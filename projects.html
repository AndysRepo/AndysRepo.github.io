<p>Here are some of the projects I've been working on:</p>

[<u>Biophysics</u>] EDES tutorial.<br>
<a href="https://molmod.dsf.unica.it/edes/">In this page</a> you will find a tutorial for the protocol the "Enhanced Sampling of Binding and Pocket Volume and Shape" (EDES) developed during my Ph.D. <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00730">(link to the publication)</a>. In the tutorial, we will exploit enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics, namely metadynamics, to improve the sampling of bound-like (holo) conformations of a generic protein starting from its unbound (apo) one.
